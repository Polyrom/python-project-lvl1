## Welcome to the Brain Games!
#### A simple set of 5 tiny console-run arithmetic games, my first study project from Hexlet. 
#### Fun for the whole family! Perfect for ages 2 to 100!

#### To start out, just type the following command in your command line while in the game directory:
```make package-install```

#### Now you are ready to go!
#### You can play the following games:
- [x] Odd or Even?
- [x] Calc It Now!
- [x] Greatest Common Divider!
- [x] Fill in the Gap!
- [x] Prime or Composite?

### This is how you play *Odd or Even?*
